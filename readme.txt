Javatari for Javascript!

(FORKED VERSION)

This fork of https://github.com/ppeccin/javatari.js hacks out various things to make it more ideal for use as a standalone web player for a single game. All changes included will, of course, continue to adhere to the Affero GPL license included.

Note that the ROM that this player references is not included here, as it isn't a part of Javatari itself, and it is licensed under its own terms.
