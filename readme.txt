Javatari for Javascript!

This fork hacks out various things to make it more ideal for use as a standalone web player for a single game.
All changes included will, of course, continue to adhere to the Affero GPL license included.
The ROM that this player references is not included here, as it isn't a part of Javatari itself, and it is licensed under its own terms.
